Description: Produces distributional forecasts using a linear quantile 
    regression process model. That is, by fitting a linear quantile
    regression for all quantile levels between 0 and 1. Essentially
    a wrapper around the quantreg package, giving predictive outputs
    as distribution ("dst") objects from the "distplyr" package.
